how jvm will work internally



ANSWER:

Loading: JVM loads Java bytecode (compiled .class files) into its memory.

Verifying: It verifies the bytecode to ensure it meets security and structural requirements.

Executing: JVM interprets the bytecode line by line or uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert bytecode into native machine code for improved performance.

Memory Management: JVM manages memory allocation for objects and uses garbage collection to reclaim unused memory.

Runtime Environment: It provides runtime support for various Java features like exception handling, multi-threading, and dynamic class loading.

Platform Independence: JVM abstracts the underlying hardware and operating system, allowing Java programs to run on any platform without modification.
