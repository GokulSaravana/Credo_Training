In Java, there are three types of variables:

1)Local Variables:

Declared within a method, constructor, or block.


2)Instance Variables (Non-static Variables):

Declared at the class level but outside of any method, constructor, or block

3)Class Variables (Static Variables):

Declared with the "static" keyword at the class level but outside of any method, constructor, or block.
